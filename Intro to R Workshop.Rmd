# I. Basic of RStudio
Comparing R and R Studio: R is like an engine running all the code, while RStudio is a dashboard that users can interact with. It is an interface with add-ons of many convenient features and tools, making R much easier to use. Throughout this workshop, as well as three other sessions, Basic Quantitative Methods, Social Network Analysis, and Text Analysis, we will use R and RStudio.

## A. Download R and RStudio
First you will have to download R from  https://cloud.r-project.org/.
Next, download RStudio from https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/.

## B. RStudio
RStudio has many features that are much more convenient for users. Typically, on the RStudio Screen, you should see four parts:

![](/Users/Chanya/Documents/Intro_R/Picture1.png)

- Console
- Workspace and History
- Files, Plots, Packages, and Help
- R Script and Data View

The console is where you type commands and see the output of your codes. Once you imported the data into R and/or create new variables or a new data frame, these will be shown in the workspace on the top right of the RStudio window under the Environment tab. In the same place, there is also a history tab, which contains a list of commands you have used so far.

Similar to Stata's do file, you can save a record of your coding commands in the R script file to reproduce your work and/or save your progress. The R script file is shown on the top left of the RStudio window. If you click on a data frame saved in the environment, the data view will be available as a tab in the same place as the R script.

To start a new project, first go to File --> New Project --> New Directory --> New Project. Then, name a directory name, this will be the main directory that you have to store relevant files to be used in the project. To select a new path which this R project will be a sub-directory, click on `Browse...` and select the home directory location of your choice.

# II. Basic R Operations and Different Data Types
## A. Basic Arithmetics
R can be used as a basic calculator. Let try some basic arithmetic operations.

```{r arithmatic}
2+3
4*5-8
(6/3)+5
2^3
5%%2
```

- Addition: `+`
- Subtraction: `-`
- Multiplication: `*`
- Division: `/`
- Exponentiation: `^`
- Modulo: `%%`

## B. Variable Assignments
In order to assign a value to a variable of your choice, use the operator `<-` as shown in the code below:

```{r variable assign}
x <- 70
x

y <- 50
y

x+y

z <- x+y #combine with the arithmetic operator

z

w <- x-y
```

What is the value of w?

```{r show w}
w
```

## C. Data Types
Apart from assigning integer values to variables, you can also assign other data types to variables.
- numeric
- logical
- character

```{r different data type}
numeric_var <- 34.5
char_var <- "R Workshop"
logical_var <- TRUE
```

You can use a function (we will cover this later) `class()` to check the type of variable assigned.

```{r check type}
class(numeric_var)
class(char_var)
class(logical_var)
```

For a character variable, it should also be noted that R is case-sensitive:
```{r case-sensitive}
char_var2 <- "r workshop"

char_var2 == char_var
```



# III. Working with Various Data Structure
There are many ways to store more than one value. We will cover: vector, matrix, factor, data frame, and list. Each is suitable for different contexts.

## A. Vector
A vector can store one type of data with a dimension n x 1, using the function `c()`

```{r vector}
score_winter <- c(3, 4, 4, 4, 5, 5, 5, 5, 6)
student_names <- c("Steve", "Carol", "Sam", "Maddie", "Aaron", "Erin", "Ian", "Kyle", "Lucy")
```

Alternatively, you can also name the elements in your vector, using `name()` function:

```{r name vector elements}
names(score_winter) <- student_names
score_winter
```

You can also perform arithmetic operations on vectors:
```{r vector operator}
score_spring <- c(4, 3, 5, 5, 3, 3, 5, 6, 5)
names(score_spring) <- student_names

total_score <- score_spring + score_winter
total_score
```

Sum of all values in the vector can be calculated using `sum()` function:

```{r sum vector}
sum_all_score <- sum(total_score)
average_score <- sum_all_score/9
average_score
```

There are different ways to select certain elements in the vector:

```{r select vector element}
total_score[1]
total_score[c(2,5,7)]
total_score[c("Ian", "Kyle")]
total_score[3:9]
```

You can also filer for elements with some desired characteristics:

```{r filer vector element}
selection <- score_winter > 4
score_winter[selection]
```

## B. Matrix
Matrix also store one type of data but with a dimension n x n. We use the function `matrix()` to create a matrix object in R.

```{r create matrix}
#try this first:
?matrix

#create a matrix containing a value of 1 to 16 for 4x4 matrix,  2x8 matrix, and 8x2 matrix, respectively
matrix(1:16, nrow = 4, ncol = 4)
matrix(1:16, nrow = 2, ncol = 8)
matrix(1:16, nrow = 8, ncol = 2)
```
Note: `?` is a useful command to call R Documentation explaining the specific function you are curious about. R Documentation for each function generally contains Description, Usage, Arguments, Details, and Examples.

Going back to the vectors created earlier, now we will construct a matrix from them.

```{r matrix from vectors}
score_winter
score_spring

student_score <- c(score_winter, score_spring)
student_score
student_score_matrix <- matrix(student_score, byrow = F, nrow = 9) #byrow indicates whether you are filling the matrix by row first (T) or by column first (F), and nrow indicates the number of 9 for the matrix.

student_score
student_score_matrix
```

Notice that in the matrix, the names you have assigned to the vectors are gone. We will rename the rows and columns of this matrix using `rownames()` and `colnames()`.

```{r naming matrix}
rownames(student_score_matrix) <- student_names
colnames(student_score_matrix) <- c("Winter", "Spring")
student_score_matrix
```

Similar to vector, we can also perform basic arithmetic operations within a matrix:

```{r matrix arithmetic operations}
total_student_score <- rowSums(student_score_matrix)
total_student_score

total_score_bySemester <- colSums(student_score_matrix)
total_score_bySemester
```
Now that we have a new column, the next step is adding this new column to the original matrix we have, using `cbind()` function. To add a new row, we use `rbind()` function instead.

```{r adding column}
all_score_matrix <- cbind(student_score_matrix, total_student_score)
all_score_matrix
```

Similar to vectors, we can also select elements in matrices. As a matrix has two dimensions, we have to specify both dimensions. If you want to select all elements in a specific row or column, you can leave the number in column or row blank. Alternatively, specific subsets of a matrix can also be selected.

```{r matrix element selection}
all_score_matrix[4,3]

#select all elements in a specific row or column
all_score_matrix[7,]
all_score_matrix[,1]

#subset of a matrix
all_score_matrix[3:5,]
all_score_matrix[,1:2]
```

## C. Factor
Factor is a data type containing categorical variables, such as sex (M/F) or grades (A/B/C/D). In order to specify that a certain vector contains factor variables, we use the `factor()` function.

```{r create factor}
#back to the original example: we assign values to the sex variable for all observations:
sex_vector <- c("M", "F", "M", "F", "M", "F", "M", "M", "F")
names(sex_vector) <- student_names
sex_vector
#However, this is still a vector with characters, not factor. To turn this into a factor, we use factor():

sex_vector_factor <- factor(sex_vector)
sex_vector_factor
```

Alternatively, if you want to code an ordinal categorical such as grades, we add another argument into `factor()`.

```{r ordinal factor}
winter_grade <- c("D", "C", "C", "C", "B", "B", "B", "B", "A")
spring_grade <- c("C", "D", "B", "B", "C", "C", "B", "A", "B")

winter_grade_factor <- factor(winter_grade, order = T, levels = c("D", "C", "B", "A"))
spring_grade_factor <- factor(spring_grade, order = T, levels = c("D", "C", "B", "A"))

winter_grade_factor
spring_grade_factor
```

Take a quick overview of the factor variables with `summary()`:

```{r factor summar}
summary(winter_grade_factor)
summary(spring_grade_factor)
```

## D. Data Frame
As we have covered so far, there are various data types coming with each observation. It is more convenient to combine all into one data set. This can be done by using a data frame as a data structure. A data frame typically contains various variables of different types as columns and each observation as a row, using `data.frame()`.

```{r create data frame}
student_df <- data.frame(score_winter, score_spring, winter_grade_factor, spring_grade_factor, sex_vector_factor)

student_df
```
Useful functions to primarily inspect a data frame are `head()`, which shows you the first few observations and `str()` which shows you the structure of a data frame.

```{r inspect data frame}
head(student_df)
str(student_df)
```

Similar to a matrix, you can also select elements in the data frame.

```{r }
student_df[3,4]
student_df[3,] #select one observation
student_df[,3] #select one variable

#Alternatively, if you know the variable name:
student_df$winter_grade_factor
```

Alternatively, you can also use a function `subset()` to select elements in the data frame.

```{r subset data frame}
?subset

subset(student_df, winter_grade_factor > "C")

subset(student_df, spring_grade_factor == "A")

```

Reorder the data frame by the values of the `spring_grade_factr` variable, using `order()`.

```{r reorder data frame}
order(student_df$spring_grade_factor)
student_df[order(student_df$spring_grade_factor),]

#reverse the order:
student_df[order(student_df$spring_grade_factor, decreasing = T), ]

#only interested in the score in spring semester, ordered by the grade:
student_df$score_spring[order(student_df$spring_grade_factor, decreasing = T)]
```


## E. List
List is capable of storing many different types of variables and data structures under one name, a list.

```{r list}
student_info <- list(winter_grade_factor, spring_grade_factor, student_df)
student_info

#name each item store in the list
names(student_info) <- c("winter_grade", "spring_grade", "student_df")
student_info

#call an item in the list:
student_info$student_df
```

# IV. Install and Download R Packages
An R package is a collection of functions, developed and shared by R developers to facilitate certain needs and that are not available in base R (the default package that comes when you have downloaded R).In order to use R Packages, you will need to first install and download the packages into your work space.

## A. Install R Packages from CRAN
CRAN stands for the Comprehensive R Archive Network, which is an official R Packages repository storing R packages for free download. We can down R Packages from CRAN by calling the `install.packages()` function. Here, we are installing a `tidyr` package, which we will be using in the next part of this workshop. After installing the package, you must also load the package into your work space by calling the 'library()` function.

```{r install R from CRAN}
#install.packages("tidyr")
library(tidyr)

#installing multiple packages at once:
#install.packages(c("ggplot2", "dplyr"))
```

RStudio also provides an easy interface to install and load R packages by simply clicking on `install` button and type the name of the package you want to install. To load the package, simply go to the `Packages` tab and check the box in front of the package you want to load.

## B. Install R Packages from GitHub
Alternatively, you can also download the package from GitHub using the `install_github()` function from the `devtools` package:

```{r install from github}
#devtools::install_github("tidyverse/ggplot2")
```

# V. Reading Data into R
Last but not least, I will cover a section on how to read different files into R. Specifically, I will go over different methods to read both flat files, such as .csv, and excel sheets into R.

## A. Reading files from Base R
First, we will read .csv file into R using `read.csv()` from base R. Before running the code, make sure to download the file [here](https://github.com/chanyaaaa/Intro_R/blob/main/student_data.csv) and that you have the file in your R directory.

```{r base R}
student_df <- read.csv("student_data.csv")
student_df

#examine the structure of the data frame: do you notice anything different from the previous data frame we have constructed?
str(student_df)
```

Alternatively, you can also use the `read.table()` function to download .csv file but with certain specifications: separator is `,`. This means there are also options for other types of separators.

```{r read.table}
#specify also that the first row is the name header by including the option header = T:
read.table("student_data.csv", header = T, sep = ",") #a .csv file is basically separated by ","

#Again, do you see the same problem as read.csv() here?
```

After inspecting the data imported, we will need to change grade and sex variables into factor, using the `as.factor()` function:

```{r change to factor}
student_df$winter_grade_factor <- factor(student_df$winter_grade_factor, order = T, levels = c("D", "C", "B", "A"))
str(student_df)
student_df

student_df$spring_grade_factor <- factor(student_df$spring_grade_factor, order = T, levels = c("D", "C", "B", "A"))
str(student_df)

student_df$sex_vector_factor <- factor(student_df$sex_vector_factor, order = F)
str(student_df)

#Alternatively, you can also pre-specify the data type in the read.table function:
student_df <- read.table("student_data.csv", header = T, sep = ",", 
                         colClasses = c("character", "numeric", "numeric", "factor", "factor", "factor"))
str(student_df)
```


## B. Reading files from the `readr` package
The `readr` package is faster, easier and more efficient than the `read.table()` from base R. The difference is that the output is a tibble, instead of a data frame. A tibble is basically a data frame but is capable of additional functions, which we will learn later in this workshop.

```{r load and read_csv}
library(readr)

student_df_readr <- read_csv("student_data.csv")
str(student_df_readr)
student_df_readr

#do you notice something we need to fix here?
```

Again, the data we have displays different data types than what we would want. There is a way to specify which data type for each variable with an option `col_types` which is equivalent to `colClasses` in `read.table()` in base R:

- `c` for character
- `n` for numeric
- `d` for double
- `i` for integer
- `l` for logical
- `f` for factor

```{r specify data type}
student_df_readr <- read_csv("student_data.csv", col_types = "cnnfff")
str(student_df_readr)

#do you notice something missing here?
```

Notice that the grade factors are not ordered. If we would like to have an ordinal categorical variable, we will need to further specify the `col_types` option:

```{r ordinal categorical variable}
of <- col_factor(levels = c("D", "C", "B", "A"), ordered = T)
cha <- col_character()
int <- col_integer()
fac <- col_factor(levels = c("F", "M"))
student_df_readr <- read_csv("student_data.csv", col_types = list(cha, int, int, of, of, fac))
str(student_df_readr)
```

There is also an equivalent function to `read.table()` in the `readr` package: `read_delim()` which you can further customize in the case that the file has a different separator:

```{r read_delim}
read_delim("student_data.csv", delim = ",", col_types = list(cha, int, int, of, of, fac))
```

## C. Reading files from the `readxl` package
So far, we have only covered the flat file option. What if we want to read data from an excel file? We can do so by using the `readxl` package.

```{r readxl}
library(readxl)
excel_sheets("student_data.xlsx") #show all worksheets

student_df_2021 <- read_excel("student_data.xlsx", sheet = 1)
student_df_2022 <- read_excel("student_data.xlsx", sheet = 2)

str(student_df_2021)
str(student_df_2022)
```

Note that unlike the `readr` package, to specify the variables as factors we will need to work on this after we import data from excel:

```{r indicate factor for read_excel}
student_df_2021$winter_grade_factor <- factor(student_df_2021$winter_grade_factor, levels = c("D", "C", "B", "A"), ordered = T)
student_df_2021$spring_grade_factor <- factor(student_df_2021$spring_grade_factor, levels = c("D", "C", "B", "A"), ordered = T)
student_df_2021$sex_vector_factor <- factor(student_df_2021$sex_vector_factor, levels = c("F", "M"), ordered = F)

str(student_df_2021)
```

## D. Read data in RStudio
RStudio has a point-and-click option to import a data set, which basically run base R functions, `readr` functions or `readxl` functions that we have covered earlier. In order to do so, go to the `File` tab and select `Import Data` option.
